            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p>
                Defense of the Ancients pits two teams of players against each other: the Sentinel and the Scourge.
                Players on the Sentinel team are based at the southwest corner of the map, and those on the Scourge team are based at the northeast corner.
                Each base is defended by towers and waves of units which guard the main paths leading to their base.
                In the center of each base is the "Ancient", a building that must be destroyed to win the game.
                
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Each human player controls one hero, a powerful unit with unique abilities. 
                In DotA, players on each side choose one of 112 heroes, each with different abilities and tactical advantages over other heroes.
                The scenario is highly team-oriented; it is difficult for one player to carry the team to victory alone. 
                DotA allows up to ten players in a five-versus-five format.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Because the gameplay revolves around strengthening individual heroes, it does not require focus on resource management and base-building, unlike most traditional real-time strategy games.
                Killing computer-controlled or neutral units earns the player experience points; the player gains a level when enough experience is accumulated.
                Leveling up improves the hero's toughness and the damage they inflict, and allows players to upgrade spells or skills. In addition to accumulating experience, players also manage a single resource of gold.
                The typical resource-gathering of Warcraft III is replaced by a combat-oriented money system; in addition to a small periodic income, heroes earn gold by killing or destroying hostile units, base structures, and enemy heroes.
                This has caused emphasis on a technique called "last-hitting," which is when the player attacks a hostile unit when "its hit points are low enough to kill it with one blow".
                Using gold, players buy items to strengthen their hero and gain abilities; certain items can be combined with recipes to create more powerful items. 
                Buying items that suit one's hero is an important tactical element of the mod.

                DotA offers a variety of game modes, selected by the game host at the beginning of the match. 
                The game modes dictate the difficulty of the scenario, as well as whether players can choose their hero or are assigned one randomly. 
                Many game modes can be combined, allowing more flexible options.

                <h2>Strength</h2>

                <p>
                    Strength heroes tend to have more health and health regeneration than other heroes, making them more resilient to both physical attacks and spells.
                    Strength heroes have a great variety in their roles, including that of carry, ganker, and support, but almost all of them have some form of strong initiation and are supposed to act as tanks to some degree.
                <br>
                In addition, heroes with a large amount of strength may greatly increase the damage needed to bring a team down. 
                    With a few exception, most strength heroes are melee. 
                    Whilst intelligence heroes typically sport a strong early game, and Agility heroes excel in the late game, Strength heroes are often able to strike a balance between the two and remain relevant at all points of the game.

        <div class="personnel-band1">
            <img class="personnel-img1" src="img/Agility.png" alt="Agility"/>
            
            <div class="chris">
                <h2>Agility</h2>

                <p>
                    Because Agility heroes are the only class of heroes to gain both damage and attack speed as their primary attribute increases, they tend to have the highest physical damage output as the game progresses. This makes them scale very well with offensive items.
                    They tend to have limited disabling capabilities or nukes; almost all their abilities augment their physical capabilities or serve as positioning or escape mechanisms.
                    <br>
                    This tends to make them much more vulnerable and weak in the early game when strong offensive disables and nukes dictate the flow of kills, but also means that, with good items under their belts, they will be the ones delivering the greatest amount of damage in the late game, while also being dealt the least amount of physical damage as a result of their high armor. 
                    Agility heroes have a roughly even split between being melee or being ranged, and fit primarily into carry and ganker roles.

            <div class="matt">
                <h2>Intelligence</h2>

                <p>
                    Intelligence heroes tend to have a greater number of active abilities compared to other heroes; all intelligence heroes have at least three active abilities, with a large number of them having all four of their abilities being actives, and some even having 5 or more. 
                    Their larger mana pools and higher mana regen rates go a long way to help them use these abilities frequently. As a whole, intelligence heroes have by far the greatest number of disabling capabilities, making them essential in most lineups. 
                    The items they build also tend to be highly caster based, since those items primarily provide intelligence. 
                    With a few exceptions, most intelligence heroes are ranged. Most intelligence heroes rely on their spells for damage, but in most cases, these have static damage values only increased by spell damage amplification or damage manipulation. 
                    <br>
                    They do not scale well into the late game, so that most intelligence heroes peak during the early to mid game, where their spells deal the most damage in relation to enemy health pools and resistance, and then start to fall off in the late game. 
                    Because of this, they often fit into support and ganker roles. 
                    There are exceptions to this though, some intelligence heroes have scaling abilities which make them excellent in the late game. <br><br><br>
